My workspace for Digital Methods for Historians 2019 course. The repository contains the html-files, R-script and -project needed to create a data-set and visual overview based on the content of the Danish School Laws database. The data-set and visual overview are created as a part of the exam in "Digital Methods for Historians", autumn semester 2019.
